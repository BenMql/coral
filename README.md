# Coral v1.0 #


Coral is a spectral PDEs solver for the plane-layer geometry, written in modern Fortran and highly scalable. 
The name comes from the initial motivation, which was __Co__nvection in __Ra__pidly rotating __L__ayers (eventhough the code has now a much more general scope).

The current version is v1.0.1.
