These files were used by Meunier, Miquel and Gallet to study 
baroclinic turbulence.

To reproduce the results, one should recompile coral after the 
PL_user_sources_definition.f90 file has been copied to:
 ../../src/plane_layer/.

The resulting executable should be run with the provided
coral.equations and coral.parameters.in files. A list of 
suggested diagnostics is defined in coral.timeseries and 
coral.usrOutput
