# Coral v1.3


Coral is a spectral PDEs solver for the plane-layer geometry, written in modern Fortran and highly scalable. User-defined differential equations are entered as mere text files. Owing to its scalability, Coral is suitable for studies of widely different complexity: from quick exploratory, prototyping studies on laptops and desktop computers at moderate resolution (say 96 cubed), to demanding cutting-edge analysis of turbulent flows on HPC architectures using large grids (say 2304 cubed and larger). The user-friendly interface makes Coral accessible to both seasoned scientists and students.

The name comes from the initial motivation, which was **Co**nvection in **Ra**pidly rotating **L**ayers (eventhough the code has now a much more general scope).
