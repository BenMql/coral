    "## Benchmark 02: Stress-free Rayleigh-Benard\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "In this benchmark, we compute the fluid instability that develops when a layer of fluid is heated from below and cooled from the top in presence of rotation. The heat transport in the statistically steady state is computed and checked against values reported by Julien, Legg, McWilliams, and Werne (J. Fluid Mech. 1996). Further, suppposing an incompressible flow, we show how the problem can be formulated using velocity-pressure variables, or decomposing the velocity field using toroidal and poloidal potentials. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Governing equations\n",
    "A fluid layer of thickness $H$ is delimited by horizontal bounding surfaces, separated by a distance $H$ and orthogonal to gravity $\\mathbf{g} = -g \\mathbf{\\widehat{e}_z}$. The bottom surface is hotter than the top surface by a temperature difference $\\Delta T$. The fluid in the layer has kinematic viscosity $\\nu$, thermal diffusivity $\\kappa$, and rotates at a constant rate $\\Omega$. Following the Boussinesq approximation, we suppose that the density of the fluid varies linearly with temperature: $\\rho(T)= \\rho(T_0) \\left(1-\\alpha (T-T_0) \\right)$ where $\\alpha$ is the thermal expansivity coefficient. We make the problem dimensionless by counting length in units of $H$, temperature in units of $\\Delta T$, time in units of the diffusive time $H^2/\\kappa$ and velocity in units of $\\kappa/H$. Thus the fluid domain is delimited by $0\\le z \\le 1$. The two dimensionless parameters are the Rayleigh number (that quantifies buoyancy), the Prandtl number (the diffusivity ratio), and the Ekman number (inversely proportionnal to rotation):\n",

    "### Velocity-Pressure formulation\n",
    "A simple, stationary and motionless solution is the conductive solution, where the fluid is at rest and a linear temperature gradient exists in the layer. The governing equations for the velocity field $\\boldsymbol{u}$ and the temperature fluctuations $\\theta$ that grow on top of the linear background $-z$ are:\n",

For reference, on 20 Intel Skylake cores, using the velocity-pressure formulation, one timestep takes approximately 0.27 seconds (i.e. 5.4 core-seconds). On the same machine, the toroidal-poloidal velocity decomposition run is 25% faster, and takes 0.20 wallclock seconds (i.e. 4.0 core-seconds).\n",

    "In sum, we have demonstrated that widely different (yet mathematically equivalent) formulations of the same problems yield statistically identical solutions, that coincide with values reported in the litterature.
