    "Two physical parameters enter the diffusion coefficient: $D_0$ and $D_1$. We denote these parameters `D0` and `D1`. Additionally, all numerical prefactors have to be defined as named parameters. To illustrate this, we will define the parameter `oneHalf` In the equations`coral.equations`:\n",

    ">>Param :: oneHalf := 0.5d0 <<\n",
    "```\n",
    "Of course, numerical prefactors can often be absorbed in physical parameters. (An alternative to the declaration above would be to define a renormalized $D_1^* = D_1/2$.) However, this is not always possible, which is why we illustrate how to create a named parameter for numerical prefactors.\n",

    "## List of variables\n",

    "Coral require that the user defines four kind of variables:\n",
    "+ `>>linear_variable_kxky` are fluctuating components of fields, that are linearly coupledIt is natural to think of these components in spectral space.\n",
    "+ `>>linear_variable_mean` are horizontal-mean components of fields (i.e. functions of the vertical coordinate `z` only), that are linearly coupled. As with `>>linear_variable_mean`, those quantities are intrinsically spectral\n",
    "+ `>>linear_variable_full` corresponds to fields that are computed in physical space. They are linear combinations of fluctuating and / or horizontal-mean components. (That is to say that they are necessarily formed by combining members from `>>linear_variable_kxky` and `>>linear_variable_mean`.) Their reason of being is to be building blocks for quadratic variables (also in physical space, see next bullet). Since they are computed in physical space, these `full` variables are available for output (in the forms of volumes, slices, profiles, or timeseries).\n",
    "+ `>>quadratic_variable` are products of `>>linear_variable_full` and may represent advection. These `quadratic` variables are computed in physical space, and therefore are also available for output (in the forms of volumes, slices, profiles, or timeseries).\n",

These variables, which we denote `phiMean` and `phi`, obey slightly different equations (obtained by projecting the diffusion equation above):\n",
